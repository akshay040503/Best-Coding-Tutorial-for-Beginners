## 🚀 How to Use This Roadmap
1. **Choose a Path:** Start with the "Big Picture" video if you aren't sure which language to pick.
2. **Commit to One:** Don't try to learn all seven at once. Pick one, finish the course, and build a small project.
3. **Practice Daily:** Coding is a muscle. Use these videos as a guide, but write the code yourself!
